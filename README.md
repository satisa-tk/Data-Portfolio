## Insight and Solution from answer why question 

- Top category : found out that Health care is the most return because customer allergy to ingredient while use or just see the ingredient outside the box.
  So we can go through deeper why this happen? the show is not clear? or customer missunderstanding or contact center didn't check customer allegy before selling product.
  
- Top delivery return : found out some of delivery not following company policy, return product after call customer one times so this problem alert to Logistics team to deal with delivery company again.

- Rejected customer : Most of data return is Auto Return if customer reject often notify the relevant team to block customer ID or call customer what it happen? to save cost of transport and operation.

- Got solutions to decrease return ratio.

## Insights and Recommendations
- TV channel isn't the best channel same as previously (5 ranking) , Channel 1 is No.1 of purchase but the boardcasting cost too expensive. So telesales and internet is the best way too increase sales because it don't have hidden cost if the business need more profit.

- Bestseller of product it doesn't mean more profit like houseband product so we can upsell more houseband or R&D new product to increase net profit.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Delivery will charge of COD commission as usual but if many order will lot of cost. This dashborad show that most of customer choose COD payment So the company should pay attention how to change customer behavior to use more credit card instead of COD payment.
- Delivery cost depends on weight and distance Company charge delivery cost 200 bath or sometimes free delivery but if product is to heavy delivery cost absorb by company is more and don't have profit, So what is solution to sell it and charge delivery cost more from customer or choose another product.
