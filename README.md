## Insight and Solution from answer why question 

- Top category : found out that Health care is the most return because customer allergy to ingredient while use or just see the ingredient outside the box.
  So we can go through deeper why this happen? the show is not clear? or customer missunderstanding or contact center didn't check customer allegy before selling product.
  
- Top delivery return : found out some of delivery not following company policy, return product after call customer one times so this problem alert to Logistics team to deal with delivery company again.

- Rejected customer : Most of data return is Auto Return if customer reject often notify the relevant team to block customer ID or call customer what it happen? to save cost of transport and operation.

- Got solutions to decrease return ratio.
